# Maya python helpers
A few scripts that help automate Maya common tasks. Since I'm a rigger, most of these scripts are more useful for rigging tasks, but some of them, like the ```mesh_helpers.py```, will be usefull in different workflows as well.

Some of these modules depends on other modules to work properly, so make sure to **clone the entire folder before trying to use them**. 

I've tried to write them as self explanatory as possible and they're documented using docstrings, but please let me know if something is not clear or if you find any bug.

## Installation
There's no required instalation per se, but if you want to access these helpers directly from your Maya CLI make sure to add its folder to the ```Maya.env``` file.
